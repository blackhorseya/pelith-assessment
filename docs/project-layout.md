## **Project Layout**

This project adopts **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Clean Architecture** principles, supporting microservices
development, Docker deployment, and test framework integration. Below is a detailed explanation of the project
structure.

---

### **1. Root Directory**

#### **Key Files**

- **`Dockerfile`**:
    - Defines the steps to build the containerized deployment.
    - Includes dependencies and start commands.

- **`Makefile`**:
    - Automation script for project management and building.
    - Common targets:
        - `build`: Builds the project.
        - `test`: Runs unit and integration tests.
        - `run`: Runs the service locally.
        - `proto-gen`: Generates gRPC/Proto files.

- **`README.md`**:
    - Overview and basic usage documentation.
    - Includes architecture introduction, installation steps, and FAQs.

- **`README.Docker.md`**:
    - Instructions on building and running the project with Docker.

- **`compose.yaml`**:
    - Configuration file for deploying multiple services using Docker Compose.

---

### **2. Directory Description**

#### **`cmd/`**

- **Purpose**:
    - Contains entry points for CLI or services.
    - Each subdirectory corresponds to an independent service or command.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  cmd/
  ├── service-a/              # Entry point for Service A
  │   ├── main.go             # Main entry file
  │   └── config.yaml         # Configuration file for the service
  └── cli/                    # CLI tools
      └── main.go             # CLI entry point
  ```

- **Notes**:
    - `main.go` is the program's entry file.
    - Use subdirectories to separate services based on their responsibilities.

---

#### **`deployments/`**

- **Purpose**:
    - Stores deployment-related configurations like Kubernetes YAML and Docker Compose files.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  deployments/
  ├── example/               # Example deployment configurations
  │   └── config.yaml
  ├── k8s/                   # Kubernetes configurations
  │   ├── deployment.yaml
  │   ├── service.yaml
  │   └── ingress.yaml
  └── docker/                # Docker-related configurations
      └── docker-compose.yaml
  ```

- **Notes**:
    - Organize configurations by environment (e.g., dev, test, production).
    - Use the `example` subdirectory for sample configurations.

---

#### **`docs/`**

- **Purpose**:
    - Stores project-related documentation, such as architecture designs, API references, and developer guides.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  docs/
  ├── architecture.md         # System architecture documentation
  ├── project-layout.md        # Project layout explanation
  └── api/                    # API documentation
      └── service-a.md        # API for Service A
  ```

- **Notes**:
    - Keep documentation for each module or service separate.
    - Use Markdown for version control and team collaboration.

---

#### **`entity/`**

- **Purpose**:
    - Defines domain models and business logic.
    - Structured according to **DDD**'s Bounded Contexts.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  entity/
  ├── domain/
  │   ├── service-a/          # Domain for Service A
  │   │   ├── biz/            # Domain logic and services
  │   │   ├── model/          # Domain models
  │   │   └── event/          # Domain events
  │   └── service-b/          # Domain for Service B
  └── shared/                 # Shared models across domains
  ```

- **Notes**:
    - Business logic resides in `biz`, while models are under `model`.
    - Use `event` for handling domain events.

---

#### **`internal/`**

- **Purpose**:
    - Contains application logic and infrastructure implementations intended for internal use only.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  internal/
  ├── app/                    # Application layer logic
  │   ├── behavior/           # Use-case behaviors
  │   ├── command/            # Write operations
  │   ├── query/              # Read operations
  │   └── event/              # Application event handlers
  ├── infra/                  # Infrastructure layer
  │   ├── storage/            # Data storage
  │   ├── transports/         # gRPC and HTTP implementations
  │   └── messaging/          # Message queues (Kafka, RabbitMQ)
  └── shared/                 # Shared utilities (e.g., logging, configuration)
  ```

- **Notes**:
    - `app` handles use-case logic for user scenarios.
    - `infra` provides infrastructure support such as storage and network transport.

---

#### **`pkg/`**

- **Purpose**:
    - Contains reusable libraries and tools that are decoupled from specific business logic.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  pkg/
  ├── logger/                 # Logging utilities
  ├── tracing/                # Distributed tracing utilities
  └── config/                 # Configuration management utilities
  ```

- **Notes**:
    - Code in `pkg` should be free of service-specific logic.

---

#### **`proto/`**

- **Purpose**:
    - Stores gRPC interface definitions and the generated code.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  proto/
  ├── service-a/              # Proto definitions for Service A
  │   ├── service-a.proto
  │   ├── service-a.pb.go
  │   ├── service-a_grpc.pb.go
  └── shared/                 # Common Proto definitions
      ├── common.proto
      └── common.pb.go
  ```

- **Notes**:
    - Separate raw Proto files from the generated code for easier management.

---

#### **`tests/`**

- **Purpose**:
    - Contains test code, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

- **Example Structure**:
  ```plaintext
  tests/
  ├── unit/                   # Unit tests
  ├── integration/            # Integration tests
  └── e2e/                    # End-to-end tests
  ```

- **Notes**:
    - Organize tests using frameworks like `testing` or `Testify`.
    - Cover logic at different levels.

---

### **3. Main Entry Point**

#### **`main.go`**

- **Purpose**:
    - Serves as the program's entry point, parsing CLI arguments or configurations and launching services.

- **Typical Implementation**:
  ```go
  package main

  import (
      "log"

      "github.com/your-org/project/cmd"
  )

  func main() {
      if err := cmd.Execute(); err != nil {
          log.Fatalf("Failed to start: %v", err)
      }
  }
  ```

---

### **4. Summary**

#### **Design Advantages**

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**:
    - Each directory has a specific responsibility, adhering to DDD and Clean Architecture principles.
2. **High Scalability**:
    - New services or modules can be easily added to the corresponding directory.
3. **Collaboration-Friendly**:
    - Intuitive structure simplifies collaboration among team members.

#### **Use Cases**

- Projects with microservices architecture.
- Systems requiring inter-service gRPC communication.
- Applications benefiting from strong domain-driven design and test coverage.
